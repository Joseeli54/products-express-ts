# Product Express API

This is a test project used to create an example API with the Node.js tool, TypeScript, in conjunction with Prisma (PostgreSQL).

# Tools to install before running the API

- Install the latest version of [Node (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en "Node (LTS)")
- Install any tool that allows you to read the code and execute it from a terminal (PowerShell can also be used)
- Install the latest version of [PostgreSQ](https://www.postgresql.org/ "PostgreSQ").
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git") on your local machine, to clone the current repository.

# Installation steps
- #### Step 1: Create a new directory where you will clone the project, open a terminal positioned in that directory and run:
`$ git clone https://github.com/Joseeli54/products-express-ts.git`
- #### Step 2: Redirect your location to that cloned folder from the terminal:
`$ cd /path/to/products-express-ts`
- #### Step 3: Install the dependencies required for API execution:
`$ npm install`
- #### Step 4: In the project directory this file `.env.example`, copy the file and name it `.env`. It can also be done from the terminal:
`$ cp example.env .env`
